- Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021.

- Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex the data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry.

- As evidence of this, I've have collected a data. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively.

- I investigated why the average movie durations went down over a period of time.

- This showed my skills of Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, and Data Storytelling.
